     ```

   - Choose the directory and select the type of application (e.g., "Hello World" Worker) and whether to use TypeScript.

2. **Configure Application for Cloudflare:**
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install @cloudflare/workers-types
     ```

   - Add latest types to `tsconfig.json`.

3. **Deploy with Cloudflare:**
   - Deploy your application:
     ```bash
     npm run deploy
     ```

   - Follow the instructions provided to navigate to the project directory, start the development server, and deploy the application.

4. **Prisma Integration:**
   - Install Prisma CLI:
